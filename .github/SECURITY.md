# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

üîí **Please do NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security issue, please **[Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/alexpota/jobguard/security/advisories/new)**

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue.

## Security Best Practices

When using JobGuard in production:

### PostgreSQL Security
- ‚úÖ Use SSL/TLS for PostgreSQL connections (`ssl: true`)
- ‚úÖ Store connection strings in environment variables, not code
- ‚úÖ Use least-privilege database user with only required permissions:
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON jobguard_jobs TO jobguard_user;
  ```
- ‚úÖ Rotate database credentials regularly
- ‚úÖ Set appropriate `max_connections` for your PostgreSQL instance
- ‚úÖ Enable PostgreSQL audit logging for compliance requirements

### Application Security
- ‚úÖ Keep dependencies up to date (`npm audit` and `npm update`)
- ‚úÖ Validate job data in your application before enqueueing
- ‚úÖ Implement idempotent job handlers to prevent duplicate processing issues
- ‚úÖ Monitor logs for suspicious activity (unusual error patterns, connection failures)

### What JobGuard Does
- ‚úÖ Sanitizes error messages to remove credentials and sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Uses parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection
- ‚úÖ Validates job data size and format
- ‚úÖ Implements circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance

### What JobGuard Does NOT Do
- ‚ùå JobGuard does not encrypt job data at rest (use PostgreSQL encryption if needed)
- ‚ùå JobGuard does not implement authentication (secure your PostgreSQL instance)
- ‚ùå JobGuard does not sanitize job data payloads (validate in your application)

## Known Security Considerations

### Race Conditions
See [Known Limitations](../README.md#known-limitations) in the README for details on edge-case race conditions inherent to distributed systems.

### Multi-Instance Reconciliation
Only enable reconciliation on one JobGuard instance per queue to prevent duplicate re-enqueue attempts. See [Configuration](../README.md#configuration) for details.

## Security Update Policy
